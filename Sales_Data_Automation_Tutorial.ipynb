    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "You're a sales operations analyst at a growing company. Every week, you receive a sales report with 50+ transactions. Your job is to:\n",
    "- Calculate commissions for each sale\n",
    "- Flag data quality issues (missing information, negative quantities)\n",
    "- Clean and prepare the data for management review\n",
    "\n",
    "**Currently:** This takes 30-60 minutes of manual work in Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After this tutorial:** You'll automate the entire process to run in under 2 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Build\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a Python script that:\n",
    "1. Connects to a Google Sheet containing raw sales data\n",
    "2. Calculates commissions automatically (Subtotal × 8% commission rate)\n",
    "3. Applies business logic to flag data quality issues\n",
    "4. Writes the processed data back to Google Sheets\n",
    "\n",
    "**No coding experience required** - just follow along and run each cell in order!"

    "   - Set permissions to **Editor**\n",

    "You've created an automated sales data processing pipeline that:\n",
    "1. ✓ Connects to Google Sheets using authentication\n",
    "2. ✓ Reads 50 sales transactions into Python\n",
    "3. ✓ Calculates commissions (Subtotal × 8%)\n",
    "4. ✓ Applies business logic to flag data quality issues\n",
    "5. ✓ Writes cleaned data back to Google Sheets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Savings\n",
    "- **Manual process:** 30-60 minutes per week\n",
    "- **Automated process:** 2 minutes (just run this notebook)\n",
    "- **Annual savings:** ~40 hours per year\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reusability\n",
    "Next week when you get new sales data:\n",
    "1. Upload the new CSV to Google Sheets\n",
    "2. Update the `SHEET_URL` variable\n",
    "3. Run all cells\n",
    "4. Done!\n",
    "\n",
    "**No code changes needed** - the same script works on any sales data with the same column structure.\n",

    "- **Faster:** Process data in minutes instead of hours\n",
    "- **More accurate:** No human errors in calculations\n",
    "- **Scalable:** Works for 50 or 5,000 rows\n",
    "- **Auditable:** Everyone can see exactly what logic was applied\n",
